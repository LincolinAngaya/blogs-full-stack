# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

 route maps a request to a controller action.
 A controller action performs the necessary work to handle the request, and prepares any data for the view.
 A view displays data in a desired format.

A model is a Ruby class that is used to represent data. Additionally, models can interact with the application's database through a feature of Rails called Active Record.

Migrations are used to alter the structure of an application's database. In Rails applications, migrations are written in Ruby so that they can be database-agnostic.

 The above code is a mixture of HTML and ERB. ERB is a templating system that evaluates Ruby code embedded in a document. Here, we can see two types of ERB tags: <% %> and <%= %>. The <% %> tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code." The <%= %> tag means "evaluate the enclosed Ruby code, and output the value it returns." Anything you could write in a regular Ruby program can go inside these ERB tags, though it's usually best to keep the contents of ERB tags short, for readability.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
